# Argo CD

## What is Argo CD?
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.


## Why Argo CD?
Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative, and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.
Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.
